Node app with MySQL, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM, which follows the MVC design pattern and CRUD method.
 Node and MySQL to query and route data for the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML and jQuery for ajax calls.
### Overview

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

* The user is able to delete the burger from the database by clicking on the `Clean the dishes` button.
